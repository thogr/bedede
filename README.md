## A simple state based BDD framework for Java

**Note:**
Currently I'm experimenting a lot. So don't expect a stable API, just yet.

But, to give you an idea what Bedede is:

* It's a BDD-test framework.
* It supports State-based tests. (That's very much like Model-based testing, but without the auto-generated tests)
* But, it also supports "State-less" tests, e.g. unit tests.
* It's an API for writing BDD tests (i.e. without the textual story telling)
* Hence, the BDD keyworks **given**, **when**, and **then** are methods in the API.
* Designed by the assumption that BDD is really about describing transitions between states in a state machine.
* Supports Selenium, Mockito, Hamcrest

### State-based tests

State-based testing is when you define the expected behavior of a system in terms of a state machine. That's just like model based testing. But in this frame work you define the states as classes, and its actions as methods. The tests are the written as given-when-then rules.
The `given(S1.class).when(it->it.action()).then(S2.class)` syntax defines an expected transition from state S1 to S2 when the `action()` is performed. As the `action()` method is defined in the S1 class it can only be performed in state S1.

Example:
```java
 given(LockedDoorState.class)
.when(it -> it.turnsKey())
.then(UnlockedDoorState.class);
```
For testing web applications:
```java
given(GoogleSearchPage.class)
.when(it -> it.searchesFor("Selenium"))
.then(GoogleResultPage.class)
.then(it -> it.hasTitle("Selenium"));
```

### State-less tests

Well, it's not state-less really, since every object has its internal state. But you don't need to define a state machine to use the framework. The framework has behavior expressions, like this:
``` java
given(new BowlingGame())
.when(performing(the -> the.roll(1))).times(20)
.then(the -> the.score(), is(20));
```
These expressions use Hamcrest matchers, but in a more declarative, rule-based, easy-to-read way.
And you don't need to declare any local variable, and you need a lot less helper functions, since the code
reads well as it is.
### Usage
#### Gradle
```groovy

repositories {
    maven {
        url "http://dl.bintray.com/thogr/maven"
    }
}

dependencies {
    testCompile "com.github.thogr.bedede:bedede-core:0.3"
}
```

#### Define States as Java classes

```java
import static com.github.thogr.bedede.Bedede.*;

@InitialState
public class DoorLocked extends DoorState {

    @OnEntry
    public Expecting<BooleanCondition> shouldBeLocked() {
        return expecting(door.isLocked(), otherwise("Unexpected unlocked door"));
    }
}
```
The @OnEntry method is the guard that defines the entry condition that must be fulfilled when entering the state.

#### Define Entries to states

An Entry to a state defines the path to the state, as a `given().when().then()` transition.
By defining a `@DefaultEntry` in a state class you may access the state's default entry with the given(State.class) syntax.
But you may also use an entry explicitly, e.g `given(DoorUnlocked.byUnlockingWith(someKey)`
```java

public static class DoorUnlocked extends DoorState {

        @DefaultEntry
        public static Entry<DoorUnlocked> byUnlockingWithCorrectKey() {
            return byUnlockingWith(CORRECT_KEY);
        }

        public static final Entry<DoorUnlocked> byUnlockingWith(final Key key) {
            return entry(DoorUnlocked.class).as()
                    .given(DoorLocked.class)
                    .when(it -> it.turnsKey(key))
                    .then(DoorUnlocked.class);
        }

        @OnEntry
        public Expecting<BooleanCondition> shouldBeUnlocked() {
            return expecting(!door.isLocked(), otherwise("Unexpected locked door"));
        }
    }

```

#### Junit Tests

```java

import com.github.thogr.bedede.BehaviorDriven;

public class DoorExampleTest extends BehaviorDriven {
 //.....

    @Test
    public void shouldLockWithCorrectKey() {
        given(DoorUnlocked.class)
        .when(it -> it.turnsKey(CORRECT_KEY))
        .then(DoorLocked.class);
    }

    @Test
    public void shouldNotLockWithWrongKey() {
        given(DoorUnlocked.class)
        .when(it -> it.turnsKey(WRONG_KEY))
        .then(DoorUnlocked.class);
    }
}
```
